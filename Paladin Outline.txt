Divine Sense = 	As an Action, 
				until the end of my next turn, 
				I know the location of any celestial, field, or undead 
				within 60 feet of me that is not behind total cover. 
				I know the type of being but not the identity. 
				I can also detect the presence of any place or object 
				that has been consecrated or desecrated 
				as well with the hallow spell. 
				I can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + Charisma modifier. 
				When I complete a long rest, I regain all uses.
				
Lay on Hands = 	I have a pool of healing power that replenishes when I take a long rest.
				I can restore a total number of hit points equal to my paladin level * 5.
				As an Action, I can spend 5 hit points from my pool to cure the target
				of one disease or neutralize one poison. 
				I can cure multiple diseases and poisons in a single use of Lay on Hands,
				expending hit points seperately for each one. 

Spell List = 	Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation.
				At least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on my list.
				Choose a number of paladin spells equal to my 
				Charisma modifier + half of my paladin level, rounded down
				
Divine Smite = 	When I hit a creature with a melee attack, I can expend one paladin spell slot 
				to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage.
				The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st level spell slot, 
				plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.
				The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend. 
				(Improved = Whenever I hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.)

						we gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier.
						(Improved = range extends to 30 feet.)

					I can use this feature a number of times equal to my Charisma Modifier. I regain uses after long rest.
